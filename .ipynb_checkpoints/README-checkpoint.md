# Background
This project will use statistical analysis to see the effectiveness of defensive coordinator Wink Martindale's schemes. Is his high blitz rate beneficial or problematic to his teams? 

If you're not interested in the methodology, **the only file you need to care about is the PDF**.

# Methodology
All data is obtained from pro-football-reference.com. You can see the stats for all NFL defenses for any given year using https://www.pro-football-reference.com/years/*[year]*/opp.htm. For instance, if you wanted to see this year's data, replace *[year]* with "2023". 

If you want to see the CSVs I used, you can find it in the *Data* folder. If you want to see my code, you can open the *ipynb* files.
