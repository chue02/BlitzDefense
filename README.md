# Background
This project will use statistical analysis to see the effectiveness of defensive coordinator Wink Martindale's schemes. Is his high blitz rate beneficial or problematic to his teams? 

If you're not interested in the methodology, **the only file you need to care about is the PDF**.

# Methodology
