# Intro
Wink Martindale's defenses are notorious for his high blitz rate. Despite this, his defenses are also notorious for generating few sacks. How is this possible? Is this true for Wink's defenses, or do other teams with high blitz rates also fail to get sacks? This project will look into the analytics of the effects of blitzing on defenses to answer the previous questions and find other conclusions.

# Background
The 2023 season for the Giants has, needless to say, been a tumultuous one. Admist the turmoil fans frequently debated on many topics regarding the team, including the effectivness of Wink Martindale as a defensive coordinator. This was a particularly contentious debate due to the defense's inconsistent performances. On week 7 they allowed just 7 points against a Commanders offense that was averaging **22.17 pts/gm** before that game. Two weeks later they allowed 30 points from a Raiders team led by rookie Aidan O'Connell. This was particularly embarassing since the Raiders had not scored more than 21 points in *any game* before they played the Giants.

Some fans forgave the defense's inconsitencies since they won games for our woeful offense. Some fans accepted a departure from Wink (some even supported this) and believed his obstinate penchant for blitzing were costing teams games. I personally leaned towards the former. I believed Wink's defenses could improve by adding additional talent on defense and having an offense that could sustain drives. 

Despite this, I was still curious about how effective his blitz-heavy defenses actually were. With Wink's departure under (allegedly) acrimonious circumstances, I decided it was time to analyze the effectiveness of blitz-heavy defenses. Did Wink's defenses struggle with his philosophy, or do other teams defenses with similar principles have similar struggles? What can Giants expect from a coordinator who has a lower blitz rate? Is there even a correlation between blitz rate and defensive metrics?

# Methodology
All data is obtained from pro-football-reference.com. You can see the stats for all NFL defenses for any given year using https://www.pro-football-reference.com/years/*[year]*/opp.htm. For instance, if you wanted to see this year's data, replace *[year]* with "2023".

If you want to see the CSVs I used, you can find it in the *Data* folder. If you want to see my code, you can either open the *ipynb* files or the *HTML* files to see the rendered Markdown and Python code. I recommend using the *HTML* files, since all you need is your browser to open it.
